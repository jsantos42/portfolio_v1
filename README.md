# Portfolio
Website showcasing my main projects.\
Done from scratch with **React.js**

### NOTE
There's a **know issue with Routes and deployment with GH pages**. For instance, if you go
to the projects page and then reload, it will not find the page. In the future, I'm 
considering deploying on another server to avoid this issue.

### How to run:
`npm install`\
`npm start`
